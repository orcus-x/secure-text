# secure-text
This PowerShell script provides a simple GUI-based method to encrypt and decrypt text using AES encryption. The script ensures secure storage of sensitive information by encrypting input text and saving it to a file (key.dat). It also allows decryption of the stored data and automatically copies it to the clipboard.
